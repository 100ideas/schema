## Authoring a type schema

For each type, there are two files:

- `<type>.schema.yaml` is the JSON Schema, written in YAML, for the type.

- `<type>.md` documentation for the type including examples and a description of design considerations for the schema

### Writing `<type>.schema.yaml` files

See [Writing Schema Definitions](docs/writing-schema-definitions.md)

### Writing `<type>.md` documentation

See [Writing Schema Docs](docs/writing-schema-docs.md)
