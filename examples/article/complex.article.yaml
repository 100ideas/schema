          In September 2017 eLife announced the start of the Reproducible
          Document Stack (RDS) project, a collaboration between Substance,
          Stencila and eLife to support the development of an open-source
          technology stack aimed at enabling researchers to publish reproducible
          manuscripts through online journals. Reproducible manuscripts enrich
          the traditional narrative of a research article with code, data and
          interactive figures that can be executed in the browser, downloaded
          and explored, giving readers a direct insight into the methods,
          algorithms and key data behind the published research.

          , based on one of Errington’s papers in the Reproducibility Project:
          Cancer Biology. This reproducible version of the article showcases
          some of what’s possible with the new RDS tools, and we invite
          researchers to explore the newly available opportunities to tell their
          story.
