### Frictionless Data Tabular Data Package

The Tabular Data Package defines data in a similar format to what the Stencila schema describes however it is designed to be used with a schema/data definition in one file, and the data in its own CSV file. A `path` property in the data definition file is used to record this relationship.

The Stencila schema stores data in separate DatatableColumns, where each DataTableColumn should have its own schema.
