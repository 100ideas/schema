### Open Containers Initiative

This is "inspired" by the [OCI Runtime Config Schema](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/schema/config-schema.json)

There are a number of properties that did not seem relevant to our use as well as some references that did not seem to be required. We try to stay consistent with the naming used but have dereferenced and combined the config schema and [Linux Schema](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec/blob/master/schema/defs-linux.json) to use the cpu and memory limits.
