# This index simply provides an entry point for the generation
# of Typescript type defintions. If you are finding that 
# type definitions are not being generated for a type then you may
# need to add them here.
# Note only primary types should need to be added, since definitions
# will be generated to secondary and tertiary types referred to by those.
