# Organization

The `Organization` type allows you to provide details about an organization such as its legal name and departments, contact details: address, email and telephone as well as information about its funders. This type of often used to describe the `affiliations` of a [`Person`](/Person).

## Example

The example below are based on the University of Otago and show different ways of specifying an `Organization`. [The University of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz/) is the oldest university in Aotearoa New Zealand.

<!--
These examples will eventually be wrapped in React components
to illustrate how the input is converted into Stencila JSON
See https://github.com/stencila/schema/issues/45
-->

The University of Otago can be represented in canonical Stencila JSON by:

```json
{
  "type": "Organization",
  "address": "362 Leith Street, Dunedin 9054, New Zealand",
  "brands": [
    {
      "type": "Brand",
      "logo": "http://www.otago.ac.nz/logo"
    }
  ],
  "contactPoints": [
    {
      "availableLanguages": ["English", "MƒÅori"],
      "emails": ["office@otago.ac.nz"],
      "telephone": "00641234567"
    }
  ],
  "departments": [
    { "type": "Organization", "legalName": "Commerce" },
    { "type": "Organization", "legalName": "Health_Sciences" },
    { "type": "Organization", "legalName": "Humanities" }
  ],
  "funders": [
    { "type": "Organization", "legalName": "MBIE" },
    { "type": "Organization", "legalName": "CancerSociety" }
  ],
  "legalName": "The University of Otago"
}
```

The schema allows for an `Organization` to have a `parentOrganization`. For example, `parentOrganization` to a department is a university.

```json
{
  "type": "Organization",
  "address": "Sciences Building, Dunedin, New Zealand",
  "legalName": "Department of Natural Sciences",
  "parentOrganization": {
    "type": "Organization",
    "legalName": "The University of Otago"
  }
}
```

### JATS

`Organization` is analagous to the JATS
[`<institution-wrap>`](https://jats.nlm.nih.gov/archiving/tag-library/1.1/element/institution-wrap.html) element
which is a wrapper element to hold both the name of an institution (`<institution>`) and any identifiers for that institution (`<institution-id>`).

### OpenDocument

`Organization` is analogous to the Open Document [`<text:organizations>`](http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/os/OpenDocument-v1.2-os-part1.html#__RefHeading__1419060_253892949)
and [`<text:institutions>`](http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/os/OpenDocument-v1.2-os-part1.html#__RefHeading__1418948_253892949) attributes.

### Crossref

`Organization` is analogous to the Crossref Organization element [`<crossref:organization>`](https://data.crossref.org/reports/help/schema_doc/4.4.0/relations_xsd.html#http___www.crossref.org_relations.xsd_organization) which is the name of an organization (as opposed to a person) that contributed to authoring an entity. If multiple organizations authored an entity, each one should be captured in a unique organization element.
