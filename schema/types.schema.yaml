# This 'meta' schema provides a list of type schemas as:
#  - an entry point for the generation of Typescript type defintions
#  - a lookup for all types for use in `util.ts` functions
# If you are finding that type definitions are not being generated for a type,
# or that they are missing from the lookup, then you need to add them here.
